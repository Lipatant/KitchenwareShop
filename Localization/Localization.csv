CharacterSpeechBrioche0101,"WHO'S COMING?!?!"
CharacterSpeechBrioche0102,"HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!"
CharacterSpeechBrioche0103,"What what who what what what!!!"
CharacterSpeechBrioche0104,"You're not that scary actually."
CharacterSpeechBrioche0105,"What did you come here for?"
CharacterSpeechBrioche0106,"Mh, I can toast bread... It's my job..."
CharacterSpeechBrioche0107,"Uh... I'm Brioche!"
CharacterSpeechBrioche0108,"NICE TO MEET YOU!!!"

CharacterSpeechBrioche0201,"HA!"
CharacterSpeechBrioche0202,"You scared the life out of me."
CharacterSpeechBrioche0203,"Have you decided what you want to do yet?"
CharacterSpeechBrioche0204,"I wouldn't like to influence you or anything, that would be inappropriate of me."
CharacterSpeechBrioche0205,"So what do you want?"

CharacterSpeechBrioche02Route01,"What's your favourite superhero?"
CharacterSpeechBrioche02Route0101,"Not a big fan of superheroes, but I'm a big fan of the villain Electrico!"
CharacterSpeechBrioche02Route0102,"There's tension in the air whenever he's around! HA!"

CharacterSpeechBrioche02Route02,"What's your favourite game?"
CharacterSpeechBrioche02Route0201,"I love Kitchen Mama and the variety of dishes you can make."
CharacterSpeechBrioche02Route0202,"I can only imagine people enjoying all those virtual dishes."

CharacterSpeechBrioche02Route03,"What's your favourite dish?"
CharacterSpeechBrioche02Route0301,"Tartines made with goat's cheese and honey."
CharacterSpeechBrioche02Route0302,"It looks SO GOOD! SO FONDANT!"

CharacterSpeechBrioche0301,"HA!"
CharacterSpeechBrioche0302,"You scared me AGAIN!"
CharacterSpeechBrioche0303,"That's not nice!!! I've got the resistor about to explode!"
CharacterSpeechBrioche0304,"Me? You want to know more?"
CharacterSpeechBrioche0305,"Well, if you want to..."
CharacterSpeechBrioche0306,"Like most of the products here, I'm second-hand. I used to belong to a family with 2 children."
CharacterSpeechBrioche0307,"Every morning, I helped to prepare the sandwiches, to which they added a layer of jam. All kinds of jam: strawberries, figs, raspberries..."
CharacterSpeechBrioche0308,"But once the little ones had grown up, they decided to buy a more economical model of toaster, and that's how I ended up in this shop."

CharacterSpeechBrioche0401,"HAAAAAA!!!"
CharacterSpeechBrioche0402,"AGAIN! Don't you ever get tired of trying to short me?"
CharacterSpeechBrioche0403,"But tell me, while you're here, I've got a question for you."
CharacterSpeechBrioche0404,"What's your favourite way to spread bread?"

CharacterSpeechBrioche04Route01,"With butter"
CharacterSpeechBrioche04Route0101,"Loyal good... Interesting..."
CharacterSpeechBrioche04Route0102,"It's true that you can't go wrong with that."
CharacterSpeechBrioche04Route0103,"After that, as long as you use salted butter, so as not to offend the Bretons."

CharacterSpeechBrioche04Route02,"With chocolate"
CharacterSpeechBrioche04Route0201,"Ha, I see you've kept your childlike spirit."
CharacterSpeechBrioche04Route0202,"I'm not saying it's bad, on the contrary!"

CharacterSpeechBrioche04Route03,"With jam"
CharacterSpeechBrioche04Route0301,"Like my previous owners..."
CharacterSpeechBrioche04Route0302,"HA! Nothing! Don't worry, you didn't do anything wrong."

CharacterSpeechBrioche04Route04,"Plain"
CharacterSpeechBrioche04Route0401,"Hahaha! Toast, nothing more?"
CharacterSpeechBrioche04Route0402,"Afterwards, if you like, I can help you choose something to go with it."
CharacterSpeechBrioche04Route0403,"HA! I'm not saying it's not good for you, just that it could be better."

CharacterSpeechBriocheElimination01,"I'M GOING TO MISS YOU!!!"

CharacterSpeechEdward0101,"Who do I see there?"
CharacterSpeechEdward0102,"You're not from around here, are you?"
CharacterSpeechEdward0103,"If you're looking for a new tool for preparing dishes fit for a queen, you've come to the right place."
CharacterSpeechEdward0104,"Let me introduce myself: I'm Edward, proud descendant of my assortment of blades."
CharacterSpeechEdward0105,"I'm going to have to leave you now, as it's almost time for me to go and cut some tea leaves in my department."

CharacterSpeechEdward0201,"Good afternoon, dear."
CharacterSpeechEdward0202,"I see you enjoyed our chat last time."
CharacterSpeechEdward0203,"You sent me back delighted. Who knew that the new face on the block knew how to show their manners."
CharacterSpeechEdward0204,"However, I suspect that if you've come back, it's for a particular reason."
CharacterSpeechEdward0205,"What have you come to talk to me about this time?"

CharacterSpeechEdward02Route01,"Who's your favourite superhero?"
CharacterSpeechEdward02Route0101,"Oh darling, what a surprising question! I like Batknight."
CharacterSpeechEdward02Route0102,"Efficient, classy, always with a gadget on his belt: a perfect gentleman."
CharacterSpeechEdward02Route0103,"The first time I read one of his adventures, I fell in love with his story."

CharacterSpeechEdward02Route02,"What's your favourite game?"
CharacterSpeechEdward02Route0201,"So you like games too, I see."
CharacterSpeechEdward02Route0202,"My favourite game is the board game Stereopoly."
CharacterSpeechEdward02Route0203,"It reveals the strategic talents of all the players around the table."
CharacterSpeechEdward02Route0204,"Every alliance, every exchange, every deal, all contribute to creating a test of the mind."
CharacterSpeechEdward02Route0205,"But don't worry, I know how to have fun too! Haha!"

CharacterSpeechEdward02Route03,"What's your favourite food?"
CharacterSpeechEdward02Route0301,"There's nothing better than good biscuits dipped in a cup of tea imported from the other side of the world."
CharacterSpeechEdward02Route0302,"Every gentleman's drink is, of course, the classiest there is."

CharacterSpeechEdward0301,"So I can see that you're enjoying my company more and more. I want you to know that the feeling is mutual."
CharacterSpeechEdward0302,"Say, I have the impression that something isn't quite right, so what's going on?"
CharacterSpeechEdward0303,"My story?"
CharacterSpeechEdward0304,"We're all second-hand objects in this shop."
CharacterSpeechEdward0305,"Each of us has brought our own story with us."
CharacterSpeechEdward0306,"In my case, I was part of a set of knives belonging to a Michelin-starred chef."
CharacterSpeechEdward0307,"Every day, she cooked sumptuous dishes for her customers."
CharacterSpeechEdward0308,"I'll leave you to imagine the immeasurable joy on people's faces when they were about to taste the most refined cuisine."
CharacterSpeechEdward0309,"However, following a collaboration with another knife brand, my owner was forced to replace me."
CharacterSpeechEdward0310,"Every night, when the shop lights go out, I still remember the moment when my brothers and I were sold."
CharacterSpeechEdward0311,"This feeling of being falling down, my fair Darling."
CharacterSpeechEdward0312,"Despite all that, like any gentleman should, I picked myself up and decided to stop feeling sorry for myself."
CharacterSpeechEdward0313,"Which brings me to my meeting with you."
CharacterSpeechEdward0314,"Next time, it will be your turn to tell me your story."

CharacterSpeechEdward0401,"I see you still think highly of me, despite what happened last time."
CharacterSpeechEdward0402,"You know, I really enjoy our little chats. My word as a gentleman."
CharacterSpeechEdward0403,"However, let's stop talking about me."
CharacterSpeechEdward0404,"Out of curiosity, I'd like to know your favourite kind of music."

CharacterSpeechEdward04Route01,"Classical"
CharacterSpeechEdward04Route0101,"Expected response from a gentleman, I suppose."
CharacterSpeechEdward04Route0102,"Ludwig van Beethoven, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Antonio Lucio Vivaldi, the geniuses of the past who will remain so centuries from now."
CharacterSpeechEdward04Route0103,"I know what you mean. I myself enjoy the sound of violins on the radio."

CharacterSpeechEdward04Route02,"Jazz"
CharacterSpeechEdward04Route0201,"You, you must like to dance."
CharacterSpeechEdward04Route0202,"I have to admit I can't help but appreciate a virtuoso improvising with passion."
CharacterSpeechEdward04Route0203,"Alternating between recalling the heart of the music, fiery volleys and quarter-tone titillations."

CharacterSpeechEdward04Route03,"Pop"
CharacterSpeechEdward04Route0301,"Very interesting indeed!"
CharacterSpeechEdward04Route0302,"Sweet summer themes, catchy drum machines and hits that go round the world. I know what you mean."
CharacterSpeechEdward04Route0303,"But I have to admit that my knowledge of this genre is somewhat limited. Perhaps you'd like to tell me more."

CharacterSpeechEdward04Route04,"Rock"
CharacterSpeechEdward04Route0401,"Rebel, I wouldn't have thought of you like that!"
CharacterSpeechEdward04Route0402,"I admit to enjoying a piece or two of punk rock from time to time."
CharacterSpeechEdward04Route0403,"Although that song or two sometimes turns into a visit to a concert... or two. Not very gentlemanly of me I suppose."
CharacterSpeechEdward04Route0404,"But hey, 'God Save The Queen' if you know what I mean."

CharacterSpeechEdwardElimination01,"In any case, I didn't think your manners were all that refined."

CharacterSpeechHector0101,"Psst! Psst!"
CharacterSpeechHector0102,"PSST!!!"
CharacterSpeechHector0103,"Hey you! Yes you!"
CharacterSpeechHector0104,"What are you doing here? You look different from the others. More flesh than metal, I see."
CharacterSpeechHector0105,"What's my name? Are you sure you want to know?"
CharacterSpeechHector0106,"You know, my name sends shivers down the spines of the local utensils trade."
CharacterSpeechHector0107,"But if you insist: people call me Hector."

CharacterSpeechHector0201,"We meet again!"
CharacterSpeechHector0202,"Still looking cool I see?"
CharacterSpeechHector0203,"I hear you've left quite a reputation around here."
CharacterSpeechHector0204,"People talk more about you now than they do about me. I have to admit it's changing."
CharacterSpeechHector0205,"What brings you back to me?"

CharacterSpeechHector02Route01,"Who's your favourite superhero?"
CharacterSpeechHector02Route0101,"If I had to choose, I'd have to go with the Finisher. He's class incarnate and his back-story reminds me of where I come from."
CharacterSpeechHector02Route0102,"He is literally me."

CharacterSpeechHector02Route02,"What's your favourite game?"
CharacterSpeechHector02Route0201,"Mmhh, interesting question. I like the game Motreid."
CharacterSpeechHector02Route0202,"The exploration, the adventure, the suspense, the action: it's all me."
CharacterSpeechHector02Route0203,"I also really like the heroine."

CharacterSpeechHector02Route03,"What's your favourite food?"
CharacterSpeechHector02Route0301,"I like... I... I like dark chocolate..."
CharacterSpeechHector02Route0302,"But don't tell anyone! It could damage my image."
CharacterSpeechHector02Route0303,"I just don't want people to see me as anything other than a tough cookie."

CharacterSpeechHector0301,"Ha! You're back!"
CharacterSpeechHector0302,"How have you been since last time?"
CharacterSpeechHector0303,"My story? Really?"
CharacterSpeechHector0304,"You know, I'm a machine like any other."
CharacterSpeechHector0305,"I was made in a small, remote country called Germany."
CharacterSpeechHector0306,"Being in the service of a karate master, I learnt martial arts in my spare time."
CharacterSpeechHector0307,"It was hard work, every drop of sweat reminding me of the sacrifices I had endured."
CharacterSpeechHector0308,"Every cramp, the people who counted on me."
CharacterSpeechHector0309,"Every tear, the steps I still had to climb."
CharacterSpeechHector0310,"By dint of perseverance, one day I reached my master's level: I was now the strongest object in the dojo."
CharacterSpeechHector0311,"However, one stormy day, the spirit of the dragon came to our monastery to challenge the being of prophecy."
CharacterSpeechHector0312,"After 6 days of fierce combat, I defeated the dragon, returning proud."
CharacterSpeechHector0313,"What do you mean you don't believe me?"
CharacterSpeechHector0314,"Well, I admit, I was pulling your leg!"
CharacterSpeechHector0315,"I'm keeping my real story a secret, to keep the mystery intact."

CharacterSpeechHector0401,"Look who's here! How have you been since last time?"
CharacterSpeechHector0402,"My real story? No, not today. Keeping the mystery and all that..."
CharacterSpeechHector0403,"What I want right now is to get to know you a bit better."
CharacterSpeechHector0404,"I wonder what your favourite type of film is?"

CharacterSpeechHector04Route01,"Action"
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0101,"Oh, I see! You like it when it explodes, when it hits and when it's fast too!"
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0102,"Well, there's a bit more to it than that, but I'm generalising..."
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0103,"I love it when it's the final confrontation, after the hero's training, and the music sounds even more epic than before."
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0104,"You know, we should share a film together, one of these days."

CharacterSpeechHector04Route02,"Comedy"
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0201,"Awesome! Me too!"
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0202,"I love absurdist humour."
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0203,"But action comedies are still the best."
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0204,"You're there, you're laughing and then there's a fight, but it's funny."
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0205,"Well, there's more to it..."
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0206,"You know, we should share a film together, one of these days."

CharacterSpeechHector04Route03,"Horror"
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0301,"Oh... Uh, me too."
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0302,"I'm not afraid anyway. Only wimps are scared."
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0303,"Take me to a horror film? Haha... Yeah, totally!"
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0304,"Oh no, you don't! Looks like I've got a setback! I think I'm going to have to leave you to it."
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0305,"It's a shame though, the film would have been cool but, well, the unexpected..."

CharacterSpeechHector04Route04,"Romance"
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0401,"Pff! That's so corny!"
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0402,"It's for wimps anyway."
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0403,"You're there and you go: oh dear, I want to see people kissing."
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0404,"Or maybe it's to compensate for a lack of affection."
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0405,"Or even to insist that Balla should go out with Richard the vampire WHEN EVERYONE KNOWS THAT JACQUES THE WOLF IS BETTER!"
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0406,"I, I..."
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0407,"OK, I admit, I sometimes watch romances..."
CharacterSpeechHector04Route0408,"BUT DON'T TELL ANYONE!"

CharacterSpeechHectorElimination01,"You don't know what you're missing, pfff."

CharacterSpeechKirpich0101,"*BONK*"
CharacterSpeechKirpich0102,"I didn't mean to bump into you"
CharacterSpeechKirpich0103,"Are you all right?"
CharacterSpeechKirpich0104,"I hope I didn't break anything."
CharacterSpeechKirpich0105,"What's my name? Kirpich."
CharacterSpeechKirpich0106,"I'll leave you to it. Do svidaniya."

CharacterSpeechKirpich0201,"Dobroye utro."

CharacterSpeechKirpich02Route01,"What's your favourite superhero?"
CharacterSpeechKirpich02Route0101,"I like the superhero the Thing, he's cool, orange and destructive."
CharacterSpeechKirpich02Route0102,"Sorry, it's hard for me to talk about myself."

CharacterSpeechKirpich02Route02,"What's your favourite game?"
CharacterSpeechKirpich02Route0201,"I like T-Trys, it reminds me of my childhood."
CharacterSpeechKirpich02Route0202,"Sorry, it's hard for me to talk about myself."

CharacterSpeechKirpich02Route03,"What's your favourite food?"
CharacterSpeechKirpich02Route0301,"I like briks, even though I've never tried them."
CharacterSpeechKirpich02Route0302,"Sorry, it's hard for me to talk about myself."

CharacterSpeechKirpich0301,"Dobroye utro."
CharacterSpeechKirpich0302,"How have you been since last time?"
CharacterSpeechKirpich0303,"My story?"
CharacterSpeechKirpich0304,"If you insist."
CharacterSpeechKirpich0305,"I was made in Russia 70 years ago."
CharacterSpeechKirpich0306,"Originally, I was just another brick that was supposed to form a wall."
CharacterSpeechKirpich0307,"However, one man decided to use me as a kitchen utensil."
CharacterSpeechKirpich0308,"I was then used as a chopping board, to crush, to raise..."
CharacterSpeechKirpich0309,"I loved my life."
CharacterSpeechKirpich0310,"However, one day, the man was arrested by the police for obscure reasons."
CharacterSpeechKirpich0311,"Since then, I've wandered from building to building until I came across this shop."
CharacterSpeechKirpich0312,"Now you know everything."

CharacterSpeechKirpich0401,"While you're here, I'd like to find out more about you."
CharacterSpeechKirpich0402,"If you were alone on a desert island, what would you take with you?"

CharacterSpeechKirpich04Route01,"A toolbox"
CharacterSpeechKirpich04Route0101,"Not bad, enough to make a shelter and everything..."
CharacterSpeechKirpich04Route0102,"Interesting, you're getting ready to make yourself comfortable."

CharacterSpeechKirpich04Route02,"An emergency kit"
CharacterSpeechKirpich04Route0201,"Are you playing it safe?"
CharacterSpeechKirpich04Route0202,"Of course, who knows what could happen in a hostile environment."

CharacterSpeechKirpich04Route03,"A telephone"
CharacterSpeechKirpich04Route0301,"We'll just have to hope there's a network, won't we?"
CharacterSpeechKirpich04Route0302,"It's true that I didn't say where this island was."
CharacterSpeechKirpich04Route0303,"You got me."

CharacterSpeechKirpich04Route04,"A brick"
CharacterSpeechKirpich04Route0401,"I'm honoured, but I'm not sure it's the best choice."
CharacterSpeechKirpich04Route0402,"You won't be able to build a shelter with just one brick."

CharacterSpeechKirpichElimination01,"Believe me, I'm very sad."
